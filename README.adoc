= CloudBees Feature Management React Examples

A collection of React examples demonstrating various patterns and capabilities of CloudBees Feature Management.

== Overview

This repository contains multiple example applications, from basic flag usage to advanced patterns like A/B testing, targeting, and configuration management. Each example is a standalone React + TypeScript application that you can clone and run independently.

== Quick Start

=== Choose an Example

Navigate to the example you want to explore:

[source,bash]
----
cd examples/01-basic-example
----

=== Install Dependencies

[source,bash]
----
npm install
# or
yarn install
----

=== Add Your SDK Key

. Go to *Feature management* > *Installation* in the link:https://cloudbees.io[CloudBees platform UI]
. Select an environment (or create a new one)
. Copy the SDK key from the installation instructions
. Open `src/feature-management/FeatureFlagsProvider.tsx` in your chosen example
. Replace `<YOUR-SDK-KEY>` with your actual SDK key

[source,typescript]
----
const sdkKey = 'your-actual-sdk-key-here'
----

=== Run the Application

[source,bash]
----
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
----

Then open the provided URL (usually `http://localhost:5173`) in your browser.

=== Test the Integration

. In the CloudBees platform UI, go to *Feature management*
. You should see flags from your running example
. Update flag values and watch changes appear in real-time

== Learning Path

We recommend exploring the examples in order:

. *Basic Example*: Understand SDK setup and simple flag types
. *Nested Flags*: Learn flag dependencies and hierarchies
. *Config Management*: Master multi-environment configurations
. *Impression Handler*: Track flag evaluations for analytics and feature adoption
. *Dynamic API*: Access flags dynamically for plugin systems and runtime configurations
. *Flag Freeze*: Control when configuration changes take effect with freeze levels

== Contributing

Each example is self-contained and can be enhanced independently. When adding new patterns:

. Keep examples focused on specific concepts
. Include detailed comments in code
. Update the example's README with clear explanations
. Add your example to the table above
